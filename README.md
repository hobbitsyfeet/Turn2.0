# Turn2.0
Turn based game (In development)
Description:
A learning experience and experimental game under development by Justin Petluk,
(3nd Year, Computer Science at University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada)

Dependencies:
Cmake: https://cmake.org/
OpenGL: https://www.opengl.org/
freeglut: http://www.glfw.org/

NOTE: If you do not have CMake you will not be able to compile this program. Along with OpenGL dependency.
GLFW is included under directory Turn2.0/resources/, no download is needed. Perhaps this will be the same for OpenGL soon.

Compile instructions:
1. Go into Turn2.0/build
2. Type: cmake -G "<Compiler> Makefiles" ../
	 where <Compiler> is the supported types of makefiles cmake supports.
3. Type: make (for GNU Makefiles, or other 'Make' commands supported by your system)

At this point you should have all the executables.
